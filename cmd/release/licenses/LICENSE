This is not the license for this codebase. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS BINARY.

This file gets replaced at build/deploy-time with the LICENSE file in the
repository root.

During the CI build/deploy, licenses for all dependencies (as found by running
"dep status") are downloaded from GitHub and embedded into the binary, ensuring
that they are presented to the end user when this command is executed. If the
license for one or more dependencies cannot be retrieved this way, the CI build
will log this and fail. You will see a message such as:

Shopify/sarama: not found!

If you see a message like this, you can fix it by creating a file named
"$OWNER--$NAME" (no extension) in this directory with the license text. In the
above example, you would create a file named "Shopify--sarama".
